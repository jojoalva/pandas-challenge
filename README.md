# pandas-challenge
Description: This challenge was to read a csv file which contained data on some city schools, their pass rates for reading and maths, and overall success rates of students passing.
In this repository you will find a "Resources" Folder which has the two csv files which have been merged in the Jupyter Notebook before analysing began. There is also a Word document describing the data which has been analysed, with some recommendations for prospective parents looking for schools for their children.

Data analysed is as follows:
    
  **District Summary**
      
      Total number of unique schools
      
      Total students
      
      Total budget
      
      Average math score
      
      Average reading score
      
      % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
      
      % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
      
      % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

  **School Summary**      
      
      School name
      
      School type
      
      Total students
      
      Total school budget
      
      Per student budget
      
      Average math score
      
      Average reading score
      
      % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
      
      % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
      
      % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

  **Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)**

  **Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)**

  **Math Scores by Grade- 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th at each school**

  **Reading Scores by Grade- 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th at each school**

  **Scores by School Spending**

  How to run:
  Ensure you have downloaded the repository first, then load Jupyter Notebook within that downloaded folder using your Terminal. Run each cell starting from the top to obtain the data you require.
